⚙️ How It Works
1.🔒 Fingerprint Authentication

    🖐️ Voter scans their fingerprint

    ✅ System matches it to stored fingerprint ID

2.🛂 Vote Validation

    🔍 System checks if the voter has already voted

    🎫 If not, they are allowed to vote once

3.🗳️ Vote Recording

    🧾 Vote is securely stored against the voter ID

    🚫 Voting is disabled for that ID thereafter

4.📊 Result Display

    👩‍💼 Admin can view total votes per candidate after voting ends
